First, this industry is highly competitive. Second, diversity of food types and competition in those are significant as well. In addition, preference of locals (and tourists in some cases) can be wide ranging depending on state, city and even nirghbourhood. Thus as a business owner who wants to open business in this industry, challanges are paramount even if he/she is resident of the city. It is even more challanging to open the same business another city that you know little about, regardless wether you are planning to move or trying to expand your successful business to another city or neighbourhood. Thus it is imperative that business owner considers all the factors and variables that can affect success of business before he/she invests significant amount of time and resources in opening a new restaurant. These consideration can include local taste, similiarity between neightbourhoods in terms of other restuarants and attractions, existing competition and so on.",

He now wants to reinvest some of his profits from last two years to open restaurant with same concept in another city (Atlanta or Nashville) with similar characteristics that can ensure higher chances of success for his new business location. Besides seeing if the city is a fit, he/she also needs to consider what neighbourhoods in these cities will most likely help him succeed.",
